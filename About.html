          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I started my career as a freelance graphic design, a passion of mine that I pursued for over a decade using tools such as Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, XD, InDesign, Figma, SKetch, and others. After, I decided a career change would be best for me and began learning front end development from an online bootcamp, learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, SCSS, React, and more.</p>
          <p>As a designer, I work tirelessly to bring innovation to an idea, brand, or company. I stay on-brand while still bringing the best, most eye-catching designs to you. I take inspiration from several sources, and see if I can re-imagine them, re-purpose them into new and exciting designs.</p>
          <p>As a developer, I work to keep sites not only looking good and pixel-perfect, but mobile-friendly, with best practices in UI/UX. I love a challenge and never stop just because it might be hard.I'm a creative problem solver, and I don't stop until a solution that I can take pride in is produced. Given enough time, I can solve anything!</p>
